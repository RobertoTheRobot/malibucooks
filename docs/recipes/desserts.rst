Notes
^^^^^
Caution! Molten sugar will burn you, be careful!
Caramel will solidify in seconds, be quick when spreading over cold recipients
If baked in individual recipients one can eat directly from them, but it looks nicer if served on a small plate
To self: do about 75% of the quantities above if you are to use your usual, repurposed ceramic recipients
